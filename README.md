# Penetration-Testing-Plan

FMJ2 did the following: FMJ2 Net Shield team was tasked with developing a comprehensive Penetration Testing Plan for Design World's cloud environment. This plan outlined the approach, tools, and techniques that would be employed to simulate potential attacks on the system.  

FMJ2 did this because of this: The goal was to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the system's defenses that might not have been captured in previous assessments. This step aimed to provide a real-world perspective on the organization's security posture.  

FMJ2 outcome was that: The Penetration Testing Plan outlined a detailed methodology, including both automated tools and manual testing, to uncover potential vulnerabilities. It specified the scope, objectives, and anticipated outcomes of the penetration test.  

The next logical step is: To execute the penetration test as per the plan.
